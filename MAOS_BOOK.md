# 📦 MASTER META MEGA CODEX — MAOS ACTIVATION STACK (v1)

**Unified • Charter-Governed • Complete • Ready for Deployment**

This Codex is the authoritative, all-in-one, sealed operational manual + governance spine + activation runbook for MAOS (Modular Automation Operating System). No gaps. No fragmentation. No “in another file.” Everything necessary to run, govern, activate, recover, seal, and evolve MAOS is here.

---

## LAYER 0 — CANONICAL POSITIONING

- Governs Activ8 AI → MAOS → DMAOS → LMAOS and all forks.
- Charter supremacy is absolute.
- STOP–RESET–REALIGN (SRR) is the top-level override.
- Dual-Agent Backup Protocol always active (Prime + Claude).
- No unauthorized external relays.
- Timestamps locked to America/Chicago.
- Every asset traces to Genesis.
- This Codex is the single source of truth.

---

## LAYER 1 — GENESIS MODEL

MAOS is a governed, autonomous, multi-agent system backed by telemetry, secured by ledger, scored for drift, enforced by Charter, versioned by seals, and built for real-world execution.

Constraints:

- Governance cannot be bypassed.
- Telemetry must run continuously.
- Ledger writes are immutable.
- Drift 0–10 green, 11–30 yellow, 31+ mandatory SRR.
- All actions trace to Genesis.

---

## LAYER 2 — SYSTEM SPINE

Required directories:

```
/configs
/orchestration/MCP
/memory/sql_store
/memory/vector_store
/custody
/scripts
/agent_hub
/telemetry
/relay
/autonomy
/seals
```

Core components: MCP Relay Server, Memory Pack v1, Custodian Ledger, Secrets Relay, Telemetry Engine, Autonomy Kernel, Prime/Claude Agent Hub, Relay Mesh (Slack, Notion, Teamwork), Governance Mesh. This spine is non-optional.

---

## LAYER 3 — CORE PACK v1 CODEDROP

Full Core Pack v1 modules are included (see Appendix A): MCP server, memory stores, ledger schema, telemetry engine, autonomy loop, agents, secrets loader, activation scripts. Drop-in ready, executable form.

---

## LAYER 4 — ACTIVATION SEQUENCE

Canonical boot order:

1. Verify Core Pack v1.
2. Load secrets via Notion registry.
3. Initialize Custodian Ledger.
4. Start MCP.
5. Emit first heartbeat.
6. Activate agents.
7. Start autonomy loop.
8. Engage telemetry → governance mesh → drift scoring.
9. Seal MVP_v0.
10. Generate evidence packs.
11. Register activation log.

Sequence cannot change.

---

## LAYER 5 — TELEMETRY SYSTEM

Signals: heartbeat, drift score, governance compliance, seal alignment, load, ledger health. Routes: Slack, Notion, Teamwork, Custodian Ledger. Drift rules: 0–10 green, 11–30 yellow, 31–100 red (SRR instant). Telemetry is the pulse.

---

## LAYER 6 — GOVERNANCE SYSTEM

Governance enforces Charter constraints, agent guardrails, forbidden ops, activation discipline, ledger correlation, RoleID approvals, incident triggers, SRR overrides, seal validity. Governance is the nervous system.

---

## LAYER 7 — CUSTODIAN LEDGER

Ledger guarantees append-only, immutable, UTC+CT timestamps, correlation-linked, drift-scored, incident-aware, seal-versioned records. Schema defined in Appendix A. Ledger is the memory of truth.

---

## LAYER 8 — ACTIVATION LOG PROTOCOL

Each run outputs run_id, correlation_id, environment, seal version, governance status, drift summary, ledger cross-links, evidence references. Enables forensic reconstruction.

---

## LAYER 9 — EVIDENCE SYSTEM

Slack pack: heartbeats, drift reports, seal announcements, governance alerts.  
Teamwork pack: evidence logs, seal docs, drift slices.  
Notion pack: activation ledger, seal registry, governance incidents, daily snapshots.  
Evidence completes the audit trail.

---

## LAYER 10 — MVP SEAL SYSTEM

Seals: MVP_v0 ignition, MVP_v1 integration, MVP_v2 orchestration, MVP_v3 KPI layer, MVP_v4 autonomy mesh.

Seal conditions (all true): MCP online, memory online, telemetry active, agents active, autonomy loop running, drift < 10, governance enforced, ledger healthy. Seals are versioned truth statements.

---

## LAYER 11 — DAILY AUTONOMY SNAPSHOT

Captures heartbeats, drift history, governance events, ledger integrity, seal version, component status, qualitative notes. Daily operational truth capsule.

---

## LAYER 12 — GOVERNANCE INCIDENT SYSTEM

Triggers: drift > 30, governance violation, MCP fault, memory fault, seal misalignment, relay anomaly.

Requirements: log, ledger link, approval, resolution, snapshot update. Governance reacts immediately.

---

## LAYER 13 — CLIENT INTELLIGENCE LAYER

Feeds from the Master Client Operational Matrix (Notion). Tracks KPIs, revenue, authority, heartbeat, risks, governance state, deliverables, MAOS mappings. Drives operational intelligence.

---

## LAYER 14 — FULL SYSTEM CHECKLIST

```
[ ] Core Pack v1 installed
[ ] Secrets loaded
[ ] MCP online
[ ] Heartbeat emitted
[ ] Agents activated
[ ] Autonomy loop running
[ ] Telemetry emitting
[ ] Ledger writing
[ ] Drift < 10
[ ] Governance enforced
[ ] Seal created
[ ] Evidence logged
[ ] Activation log stored
```

System is ACTIVE only when all are checked.

---

## LAYER 15 — MASTER SUMMARY

The Codex covers architecture, governance, activation, recovery, telemetry, drift, ledger, seals, SOPs, templates, checklists, incidents, intelligence layer. Canonical, reproducible, governed.

---

## LAYER 16 — FOUR PILLARS

Composable — components connect cleanly.  
Fungible — governed swaps allowed.  
Modular — single-purpose units.  
Stackable — layers extend upward indefinitely.  
Pillars are immutable doctrine.
