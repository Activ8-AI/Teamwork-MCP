# Meta Mega Codex — Multi-Agent Charter Standard Execution

This codex unifies every governance and execution layer—doctrine, policies, governors, resilience, logging, workflows, routing, and operations—into a single artifact that can be referenced during audits or activation sequences.

---

## Layer 1: Charter Doctrine
- Sovereign boundaries enforced at runtime
- Determinism via pinned versions and caching
- Audit immutability with append-only logs, UTC timestamps, artifact uploads
- Resilience expectations: failover states, backoff retries, watchdog escalation
- Evidence coherence through aggregated JSON binders and dashboards
- Zero drift via version-locked workflows

## Layer 2: Policies
**Domain policies**
- `activ8_domain_policy.json`
- `lma_domain_policy.json`
- `personal_domain_policy.json`

**Copilot policies**
- `activ8-ai-copilot.json`
- `lma-copilot.json`
- `personal-copilot.json`

## Layer 3: Governors
- `activ8_governor.py` — policy-enforced sweep for Activ8 AI
- `lma_governor.py` — policy-enforced sweep for LMAOS
- `personal_governor.py` — policy-enforced sweep for PERSONAL

## Layer 4: Resilience
- `resilient_governor_runner.py` — structured failover orchestration with retries/backoff
- `watchdog.py` — stale detection, escalation hooks, paging
- `governor_evidence_aggregator.py` — aggregated evidence and dashboard updates

## Layer 5: Logging Spine
- `custodian_log_binder.py` — append-only custodian log
- `genesis_trace.py` — append-only trace log

## Layer 6: Router
- `mcp_governor_router.py` — routes Activ8, LMA, and Personal governors

## Layer 7: Workflows
- `.github/workflows/activ8-governor-sweep.yml`
- `.github/workflows/lma-governor-sweep.yml`
- `.github/workflows/personal-governor-sweep.yml`
- `.github/workflows/governor-watchdog.yml`
- `.github/workflows/governor-evidence-aggregation.yml`
- `.github/workflows/governor-failover.yml`

_All GH Actions workflows pinned to `ubuntu-22.04`, `actions/checkout@v4.1.0`, `actions/setup-python@v4.7.0`, with pip caching and conflict-safe commits._

## Layer 8: Operations
**Local run commands**
- `PAT_ACTIV8_AI=<token> python activ8_governor.py`
- `PAT_LMA=<token> python lma_governor.py`
- `PAT_PERSONAL=<token> python personal_governor.py`
- `PAT_ACTIV8_AI=<token> PAT_LMA=<token> PAT_PERSONAL=<token> python resilient_governor_runner.py`
- `python watchdog.py`
- `python governor_evidence_aggregator.py`

**Invocation phrase**
- “Charter On — Execute Meta Mega Codex.”
- “Run Governors — Activ8 AI, LMAOS, PERSONAL — Charter Standard Execution.”

---

Reference this codex whenever activating, auditing, or extending the multi-agent governors so every layer stays aligned with Charter Standard execution.

## Meta Mega Codex Entries — Pull Request Records

### Meta Mega Codex Entry — Pull Request Record

Entry ID: MMC-PR-TEAMWORK-MCP-20260122  
Timestamp (CT): 2026-01-22 (America/Chicago)  
Classification: TIER 3 — Full Governance Controls  
Charter: Activ8 AI Operational Execution & Accountability Charter (AIOEAC v1.3)  
Phase: PR Created -> CI Review -> Pending Merge
Scope: Internal / Canonical (execution tracking)  

---

#### 1) PR Declaration

This entry records the creation of a Charter-governed Pull Request for the Teamwork-MCP repository, translating a sealed consolidation plan into an active execution artifact under GitHub enforcement.

This PR is a state-change event, not a new inflection point.

---

#### 2) PR Metadata (Locked)

- Repository: Activ8-AI/Teamwork-MCP
- Base Branch: main
- Compare Branch: claude/fix-resolve-merge-all-prs-KaBMl
- PR Title: fix: Resolve and merge all open PRs with security fixes and features
- PR URL: <PENDING — to be inserted once created>
- Execution Note (Agent): PR creation attempted via GitHub CLI; blocked in this environment (`createPullRequest` not accessible). Insert PR URL once created by a maintainer with appropriate permissions.

---

#### 3) Scope & Intent
Intent:

- Execute a previously sealed consolidation across multiple open PRs
- Remediate security findings and test instability
- Establish a clean, auditable baseline on main

Explicitly In Scope:

- Security fixes (npm audit -> 0)
- Test isolation and race-condition remediation
- MCP SDK update to 1.25.3
- CI workflow cleanup and Node.js 20.x standardization

Explicitly Out of Scope:

- New feature expansion beyond merged PR content
- Architectural changes outside reviewed PRs
- Any Charter amendments

---

#### 4) Governance & Decisions Enforced

- DEC-TEAMWORK-MCP-PR-001 — Consolidate all open PRs into a single governed PR
- DEC-TEAMWORK-MCP-MERGE-001 — Default merge strategy: Squash & Merge

Governance Rules:

- CI/CD must pass with zero vulnerabilities
- No secrets may be tracked or introduced
- Remediation fixes must remain within consolidated scope

---

#### 5) Expected Gates

- ✅ Build passes (npm run build)
- ✅ Tests pass (isolated fixtures)
- ✅ Security scan clean (npm audit = 0)
- ✅ Secrets untracked (.secrets.cache.json ignored)
- ✅ Node.js version consistent (20.x)

Failure of any gate requires patching on the same branch and re-running checks.

---

#### 6) Authority & Control

- Final Arbiter: Stan Milan
- Execution Surface: GitHub Pull Request + CI/CD
- Charter Enforcement: Active
- Rollback Authority: Maintainer via revert or follow-up PR

---

#### 7) Relationship to Other Codex Entries

- Parent Inflection: MMC-IP-TEAMWORK-MCP-20260122 (Post-Consolidation Lock)
- Governing Plan: Meta Mega Codex — NEXT ACTIONS (Teamwork-MCP)
- Operational Variant: Cursor Agent COV-01 (GitHub-native rendering)

---

#### 8) Status

PR State: PENDING / IN REVIEW  
System State: EXECUTING (CI gates active)

This entry remains open until merge completion.
